# Examples
Working with SLED is seamless when working with HuggingFace's Transformers AutoClasses.

_Important_: You need to `import sled` before using the AutoClass (e.g. `AutoModel.from_pretrained('tau/bart-base-sled)`) for it to work.

Minimal working example can be found [here](usage_example.py)

To work with SCROLLS like data that was used for the paper, see [here](seq2seq)
